# UFOs

## 1. Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to build an interactive webpage allowing users to filter through UFO sighting data by multiple criteria. 

## 2. Results
A user will search through UFO data by entering data into the form fields, seen below.

If the user would like to see UFO information for Fresno, CA -- they can simply fill put 'Fresno' into the 'city' and 'ca' into the 'state' form fields, and the information will populate.

This holds true for filters by date, country, and shape, and multiple form fields can been completed at once for a narrow search. 

## 3. Summary
- One drawback of this design is that it is case sensitive, so typing in "CA" will not yeild results for California.
- Further development would include fixing the case sensitivity glitch.
- Another would be including a "clear fields" button to clear all the filters and return your results back to "all".
